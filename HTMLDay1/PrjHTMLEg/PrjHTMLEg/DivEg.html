            <abbr title="Database Management System">DBMS </abbr> was designed to solve the
            fundamental problems associated with storing, managing, accessing, securing, and auditing data in traditional file systems. Traditional database applications were developed on top of the databases, which led to challenges such as data redundancy, isolation, integrity constraints, and difficulty managing data access. A layer of abstraction was required between users or
            apps and the databases at a physical and logical level.

            Software. DBMS is primarily a software system that can be considered as a management console or an interface to interact with and manage databases. The interfacing also spreads across real-world physical systems that contribute data to the backend databases.
            The OS, networking software, and the hardware infrastructure is involved in
